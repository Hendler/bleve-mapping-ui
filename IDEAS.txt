some properties are "field mappings only"
  ==> graduate up to containing DocMapping as a "propertied field"

a named field would normally be
  DocMapping...
     Properties["description"] :=
       DocMapping...
         FieldMapping{ Name: "description_en" }
         FieldMapping{ Name: "description_es" }


example
  type [default]...
  type: beer...
  type: breweries...
    fields:
      description: description_en, property: description
      description: description_es, property: description
    nested mappings:
      address...
        named fields:
          city: city_en
          city: city_es
